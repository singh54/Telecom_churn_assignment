# Customer Churn Assignment
> This project is based on the case study of a telecommunication company, which is facing a customer churn issue. The project aims at understanding the pattern of the data and predicting customers who are going to churn based on multiple variables to help the company in retaining their existing customers. The project was accomplished by building a machine learning workflow that will run autonomously with the CSV file and return the best-performing model.

## Project Objective
- The objective, as a data scientist hired by the telecom company, is to build a model that will help to identify the 
potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This will help the company to understand the pain points and patterns of customer 
churn and will increase the focus on strategising customer retention.

## Conclusions
- The ensemble-based models (Adaboost Classifier, Adaboost Classifier Tuned, and Gradient Boost Classifier and Gradient boost tuned) outperform both the Decision Tree models and the Random Forest Estimator in terms of reducing the overfitting problem and better generalisation.
- The boosting models Adaboost and Gradient Boost Classifier performed equally almost similar, as boosting which combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. Boosting algorithms iteratively train models, focusing on misclassified instances from previous iterations. This iterative process allows the model to learn and improve its predictions over time.
- The Gradient Boost Classifier demonstrated the best performance on the test stage among the compared models. This suggests that the Gradient Boost Classifier is well-suited for predicting potential churn customers on unseen data.
